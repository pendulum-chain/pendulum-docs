# Amplitude Grants Program

The [Amplitude Grants Program](https://pendulumchain.org/ecosystem-grants/amplitude/requirements) will support developers in translating EVM protocols over to WebAssembly (Wasm) for the Amplitude parachain on Kusama. The [Pendulum Grants Program](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/pendulum-launches-ecosystem-grant-program-c193237305ce) is already working with teams to fund the development of blockchain infrastructure and dApps that connect fintech fiat services to DeFi. Now Amplitude will fund builders to grow Pendulum’s Amplitude chain.

### **Benefits of an Amplitude Grant** <a href="#9461" id="9461"></a>

* Financial support
* Footprint in the Dotsama ecosystem
* Grow your network with introductions to partners in both the Pendulum & Amplitude ecosystem

A footprint in a Dotsama ecosystem, one of the most respected and lively developer communities in the entire blockchain space, is a strong benefit for any serious Web3 builder. Developers will have opportunities for technical and marketing support from Pendulum, who have co-hosted live events with [Parity](https://www.parity.io/) and have a rapidly growing community.

* **Trustless fiat price oracle →** services that remove the oracle as a single-point-of-trust
* **Transaction privacy →** optional transactional privacy features
* **Tooling for Wasm smart contracts →** something like the [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com/) for Wasm

### **Requirements** <a href="#4a2f" id="4a2f"></a>

All code must be open source and available on GitHub. Code should either be written in WebAssembly (”Wasm”) or compiled to Wasm (e.g. Solang) and can be implemented either as a pallet or as a smart contract. Individuals, universities, companies etc. are welcome to apply. The payout will be in both USDC and AMPE. AMPE is Amplitude’s native token, you can [click here](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/amplitude-ampe-tokenomics-2063d3bafde0) for the tokenomics breakdown.

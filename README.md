## What is Pendulum? 

Pendulum Chain is a smart contract blockchain network connecting fiat rails to the decentralized finance ecosystem. By bridging robust and compliant fiat-pegged tokens from the most prominent blockchain networks into the vibrant DeFi ecosystems, Pendulum addresses the ever-growing demand for fiat liquidity in DeFi. Behind the development of the open Pendulum protocol is [SatoshiPay](https://satoshipay.io), a company which has developed blockchain products since 2014.

## Built on Substrate

Substrate is a blockchain framework developed by Parity Technologies. The framework was used to build Polkadot. The advantages of Substrate are many: in addition to having native compatibility with the Polkadot chain, Substrate has cross-coding language support, forkless upgrades with built-in upgrade coordination, deterministic finality (for fast consensus reaching), and a suite of pre-built but customizable components (“pallets”).

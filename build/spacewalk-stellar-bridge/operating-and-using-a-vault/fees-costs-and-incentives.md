# Fees, Costs and Incentives

## User

Users risks are born of the trustless nature of the vault, by giving up custody to a Vault, a user accepts the risk of losing their stable-coins&#x20;

### Incentives and Income

Users can earn income through a vault:

* By earning yield / income through DeFi
* By Exchanging/Swapping to other stable-coins
* By using additional services and their rewards

Furthermore, any slashed collateral of the Vault is given to the user, providing a safety net for the possible loss of stored assets

### Costs

The only costs users faces is in issuing transaction to Issue and Redeem their coins, and in the  fees associated to every PEN transaction.

## Operator

In locking up their assets as a collateral, Vaults make a bet that their asset will either stay constant or increase in value against PEN. Should the exchange rate drop, the vault risks being at an over-collateralization state, meaning their collateral will start getting slashed.

### Incentives and Income

Vault Operators earn an income through:

* The Issue and Redeem fees&#x20;
* Slashed collateral of Users (On failed issues)
* Slashed collateral of Vaults (On failed replace)

### Costs

Operators costs are related to operation/maintenance costs, as well as any transaction fees on Pendulum
